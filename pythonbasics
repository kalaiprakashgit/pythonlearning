1) What does REPL stand for?

Correct

Correct answer
Read Evaluate Print Loop

Explanation
REPL stands for "Read Evaluate Print Loop". This means that each line is calculated and the result is printed to the screen before putting the user back at a prompt.

3) What type of loop is used to create an infinite loop?

Correct

Correct answer
A "while" loop.

Explanation
A "while" loop will continue as long as the condition is True and no "break" line exists in the loop. There is no "do ... while" loop in Python. You use a "for" loop to iterate over something that has a length.

4) Which of these can be used as a key in a dictionary? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
(1, 2), 'Kevin', 1

Explanation
Any value that is immutable (can't be changed) can be used as a key in a dictionary. Since lists can be modified, they are not usable as keys.

5) How would you get the value of the key 'color' from a dictionary called 'favorites'?

Correct

Correct answer
favorites['color']

Explanation
To read a value from a dictionary, you will use the subscript operator with the exact key ("color").

6) Which of these "is" comparisons will return True? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
1 is 1, 'a' is 'a'

Explanation
The "is" operator only returns True if both sides are the exact same object. Since both ints and strings are immutable types Python considers two identical ints or strings to be the same object.

7) How can you run a non-executable Python file?

Correct

Correct answer
python file.py

Explanation
If you want to run a single Python file, you can use it as the first argument to the python CLI. Not passing a file name would put you into a REPL.

8) Which of these would have a float as the result? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
2.0 / 3, float(6 * 3)

Explanation
Performing any math operation where one of the numbers is a float will result in a float. You can also convert an item to a float using the `float()` function.

9) What keyword is used for a second "if" in an if/else chain?

Correct

Correct answer
elif

Explanation
It's not a word, but the value used for a second "if" in Python is "elif" (short for "else if").

10) How would you get every item with an even index (0, 2, 4, etc.) from a list using slicing?

Correct

Correct answer
my_list[::2]

Explanation
The optional, third value of a slice is the "step" value. `my_list[::2]` will gather the items from the beginning of the list to the end of the list skipping every second item.

11) Which of these values would cause an `if` block to execute if used as the `if` statement's conditional? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
"test", [1, 2]

Explanation
Any expression that evaluates to True when used as the argument to the `bool` function would be equivalent to True in an if statement.

12) What would the result of 4 * '1.1' be?

Correct

Correct answer
'1.11.11.11.1'

Explanation
Multiplying an int by a string, or a string by an int, results in a new string that is the original string concatenated to itself the specific number of times.

13) When can you use a comment in Python? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
At the beginning of a line., After the final expression on a line., At the beginning of a file.

Explanation
There aren't too many places that you can't use a comment in Python, but as a rule of thumb, you should only use them on their own lines or after all of the code on a line.

14) How would you create a new variable with the value "test"?

Correct

Correct answer
foo = "test"

Explanation
The assignment operator in Python is a single "=" and will be used to create or set the value of variables. Python is also a dynamic programming language, so you don't need to explicitly provide a type for your variables.

15) How would you get the lowercase version of a string?

Correct

Correct answer
"SOMETHING".lower()

Explanation
Knowing how to lowercase a string is important because you'll likely want to compare strings regardless of how they were typed. You do this in Python by calling the ".lower()" method on string.

16) What of these shebangs can you use to utilize the system Python on a CentOS system?

Correct

Correct answer

17) Which of these are valid strings? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
"Hello 'Doug'", "It's time to\nrock"

Explanation
The first and last quote that create a string must match, either as double or single quotes, and if there are quotes within the string, they must be escaped with a \, unless they are the opposite type of quote from the outer quotes.

18) How do you exit the Python REPL? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
enter "exit()", hit "ctrl+d"

Explanation
The "exit()" function needs to be called, or Ctrl-D hit, to exit the Python REPL. Hitting Ctrl-C is a key interrupt but won't close the REPL. Entering "exit" without parentheses will display a message stating that you need to use parentheses.

19) What are valid booleans in Python? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
False, True

Explanation
The boolean objects that you'll use in Python are the constants True and False.

20) What value represents nothingness in Python?

Correct

Correct answer
None

Explanation
Unlike many languages that use the terms null or nil to represent the idea of nothingness, Python uses the constant None.

21) Which tuples could be used in `print("%s %s" % my_tuple)` without causing an error? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
('a', 'b'), (2.0, 3.0)

Explanation
The tuple used in string substitution must have the same number of elements as there are variables in the string. In this case, all tuples with two elements would work.

22) Which of these types can be iterated over? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
dictionary, string, list

Explanation
Strings, dictionaries, tuples, and lists are all examples of types that can be iterated over using a "for" loop in Python.

23) Which of these operations will return True? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
1 in ['a', 1, 'b'], 0 or True

Explanation
The example `1 in ['a', 1, 'b']` would return True because the item 1 exists in the list. The example `0 or True` would return True because "or" will return the first truthy value (True in this case) or the last false value.

24) Which of the following would NOT change the length of the `foods` list? The `foods` list contains 3 items already.

Incorrect

Correct answer
foods + ['orange']

Explanation
List concatenation without reassigning the variable is the only option that doesn't increase the length of the original list.
