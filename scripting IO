1) What package SHOULD you use to interact with external commands from Python?

Correct

Correct answer
subprocess

Explanation
All of these packages could be used to interact with external processes, but the subprocess functionality in `os`, `commands`, and `popen2` has all been deprecated (as of Python 2.6) in favor of the `subprocess` module.

2) Which functions could you use to interact with external commands? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
subprocess.call, subprocess.check_output

Explanation
The `exec` command runs a string as though it were Python code, and there is no `run` function. Both `call` and `check_output` from the `subprocess` package will execute external commands.

7) How would you call the 'strftime' function if you've imported the entire `time` package?

Incorrect

Correct answer
time.strftime(...)

Explanation
When you import an entire package, then you need to prefix your function calls with the package name. You must also use parentheses to call the function; otherwise, you are only referencing it.

8) What function would you use to read in user input as a string?

Correct

Correct answer
raw_input

Explanation
The `raw_input` function will always return a string. The `input` function reads the user input as though it was typed directly into the script.

9) What function would you use to read in user input as Python code?

Correct

Correct answer
input

Explanation
The `raw_input` function will always return a string, but the `input` method treats the input as though it was typed into the Python REPL or directly into your script.

10) Which of these function calls is valid for this function definition: `def area(length, width, height=1):`? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
area(1, 2), area(width=2, height=2, length=2), area(2, width=2)

Explanation
The function call of `area(lenght=2, 2, 2)` is the only invalid answer because you can't use a keyword argument and then follow it with positional arguments. It is valid to use positional arguments followed by keyword arguments. It is also valid to use all keywords or all positional arguments.

11) What kind of error will you receive if you can't open a file?

16) Which of these is a valid list comprehension? (Choose all that apply)

Correct

Correct answer
[item for item in my_list], [num**2 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

Explanation
List comprehensions use square brackets so the curly bracket answer can't be right. The answer of `[for item in my_list]` is almost correct, but it's missing a return value at the start.
